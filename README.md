# About the Project

This project was carried out in conjunction with the course provided by **Loiane Groner**, accessible at **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJnjz8FIs6Q&list=PLGxZ4Rq3BOBpwaVgAPxTxhdX_TfSVlTcY**.

It is a simple **CRUD** involving a relationship between **courses** and **lessons**, which its implementation was done mainly with the **Angular** and **SpringBoot** frameworks.

This was my second complete implementation of a **REST API**, containing much more details and structuring features compared to my first **API** project - **https://github.com/nathan00pdl/api-test**.

I belive that this project gave me great contact with a **REST API** that could be used in production, acording to **Loiane**, therefore being a great source of knowledge and **learning practice**. 

## Backend Structure
- **Layered architecture - MVC**
- Design pattern: **DTO** (Data Transfer Object)

## REST API
- Use of **HTTP** methods, such as **GET, POST, PUT** and **DELETE** to perform operations on resources.
- Use of **URLs** (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify especific resources.
- Data transfer between client and server in a standard **JSON** format.
- Maintaining the state of application on the client, without storing it on the server.

## Tecnologies
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.2
- Maven
- JPA + Hibernate
- Docker build
- MySQL 8.0 image 
- Angular v19
- Angular Material
