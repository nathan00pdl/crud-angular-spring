# About the Project

This project was carried out in conjunction with the course provided by **Loiane Groner**, accessible at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJnjz8FIs6Q&list=PLGxZ4Rq3BOBpwaVgAPxTxhdX_TfSVlTcY.

It is a simple **CRUD** involving a relationship between **courses** and **lessons**, which its implementation was done mainly with the **Angular** and **SpringBoot** frameworks.

This was my second complete implementation of a **REST API**, containing much more details and structuring features compared to my first **API** project - https://github.com/nathan00pdl/api-test
