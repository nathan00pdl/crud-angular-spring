# About the Project

This project was carried out in conjunction with the course provided by **Loiane Groner**, accessible at **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJnjz8FIs6Q&list=PLGxZ4Rq3BOBpwaVgAPxTxhdX_TfSVlTcY**.

It is a simple **CRUD** involving a relationship between **courses** and **lessons**, which its implementation was done mainly with the **Angular** and **SpringBoot** frameworks.

This was my second complete implementation of a **REST API**, containing much more details and structuring features compared to my first **API** project - **https://github.com/nathan00pdl/api-test**.

I belive that this project gave me great contact with a **REST API** that could be used in production, acording to **Loiane**, therefore being a great source of knowledge and **learning practice**.
